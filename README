NAME
	metar - Trivial whether report

SYNOPSIS
	metar get
	metar print
	metar set STATION
	metar list
	metar closest LATITUDE LONGITUDE [LIST]

DESCRIPTION
	metar is a simple utility for find whether stations (hence referred to
	as METAR stations,) get and raw METAR reports. Most METAR stations are
	airports.

ACTIONS
	get
		Gets the most recent weather report from the selected METAR
		station. The first line in the report will contain the station's
		name, country, code, and location.

	print
		Print the code of the selected METAR station, the station
		from which weather reports are retrieved. This is equivalent
		to running

		(cat ~/.config/metar || cat /etc/metar) 2> /dev/null | head -n 1

	set STATION
		Stores the STATION as the METAR station from which weather
		reports shall be retrieved. STATION shall be the stations's
		code. This is equivalent to running

		echo STATION > ~/.config/metar

	list
		Print all METAR stations. This can take a very long time. You
		are strongly encouraged to store the output to a file.

		Each station is will be printed on a line, containing the its
		name, country, code, and location. The code is in parenthesis.

	closest LATITUDE LONGITUDE [LIST]
		Given a LATITUDE and LONGITUDE in decimal format, print the
		code of the closest METAR station. If you have already created
		a list of all stations using the action list, specify the
		filename of that list as the LIST argument.

FILES
	~/.config/metar
		Contains a the code for the selected weather station, and
		nothing else, except an LF at the end. This will never change.
		Other programs are encouraged to use this file too.

		If the file contains more than one line, only the first line,
		even if it is empty, is used.

	/etc/metar
		Fallback file use if ~/.config/metar is missing. Other
		programs are encouraged to use this file too.

NOTES
	US Americans, remember, you are one the western hemisphere. Therefore,
	you should specify a negative longitude when using the action closest.
